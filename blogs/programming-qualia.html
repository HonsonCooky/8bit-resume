      Note: There exists a section at the end of this article that explores edge
      cases and other ideas that detract from the focus of what I'm trying to
      communicate.

  <h3>Observations</h3>
  <p>
    As communities grow, the divergence in understanding among their members
    inevitably increases. This phenomenon can be observed throughout history,
    from ancient civilizations to modern societies. The larger a group becomes,
    the more interpretations and perspectives it encompasses, leading to a
    gradual shift from the original meaning. This can be starkly seen in the
    evolution of religions, where foundational principles and teachings have
    splintered into countless sects and interpretations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, in today's rapidly expanding tech industry, the role of a
    "Software Engineer" has lost a concrete understanding. Initially, this role
    demanded a deep understanding of electronics due to technological
    limitations. However, as a result of technological advancements across the
    board, the tech industry has grown and evolved, where the role now
    encompasses a wide range of specializations and skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this community being no different than others, this inevitably results
    in conflicting ideas and understandings. I believe the differences among
    community members can be understood when acknowledging the differences in
    shared qualia - commonality in personal / subjective interpretations of code
    (and its relationship to hardware). In essence, programming can be viewed
    through various lenses: "Computer Scientists," "Software Engineers," and
    "Software Developers," each with distinct yet overlapping understandings.

  <h3>The Spectrum</h3>
  <p>
    Expanding upon this idea, the creation of abstraction tools (frameworks,
    libraries, programming languages, etc) has removed the requirement for an
    understanding beyond the code. Without a requirement to understand the
    underlying mathematical and electronic components, there emerges another
    form of programmer - which I believe has been improperly labeled as a
    "Software Engineer".
  </p>
  <p>
    A quick history of computing through the lens of this context will help
    outline this spectrum. Initially, programming was mathematical theory (Alan
    Turing). Technological advancements then enabled theory to be put into
    practice (IBM machines, Fortran), and eventually abstracted away from the
    programmer (C#, Ruby, JavaScript). We could place markers along a spectrum
    of programmers as such:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Theoretical - Computer Scientists</b>
      <p>
        Based heavily in mathematics, Computer Scientists thrive on the ideas of
        code more-so than in the implementation of it. Where Lambda Calculus and
        Featherweight Java are modeling languages - tools that enable the
        expansion of computing through theory.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Practical - Software Engineers</b>
      <p>
        At some point, we inevitably attempt to apply theory into practice,
        which is where Software Engineers find their calling. With an intimate
        understanding of hardware, delving into environments where no tools
        exist to help you is where the detail-oriented minds of Software
        Engineers can thrive.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Abstract - Software Developers</b>
      <p>
        Bringing forth the possibilities of electronic hardware to the rest of
        the world requires a breadth of knowledge across a wide array of
        mediums. For Software Developers, thriving on the abstract enables the
        implementation and management that drives the utility of computers to
        non-technical users.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>A Continuum</h3>
  <p>
    To be crystal clear, the markers above exist as transitions along a
    continuum.
