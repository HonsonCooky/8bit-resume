  <h3>Observations</h3>
  <p>
    It seems like the number of internal conflicts between programmers continues
    to grow as the definition of a "Software Engineer" broadens. Alone, this
    idea...
  </p>

  <h3>An Answer?</h3>
  <p>
    The differences between these roles seems to stem from a programmer's
    perception of code and hardware. Tools developed over the past 70
    Programming modern solutions is a complex process, which has been made
    possible for a single person with modern tools. Due to human cognitive
    limitations, there exists knowledge boundaries throughout this process. Each
    individual's perception on this continuum varies, creating unique
    abstraction boundaries. Knowledge beyond this boundary can hinder achieving
    specific outcomes. These abstraction points can be outlined as such:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Theoretical - Computer Scientists:</b>
      <p>
        For the Computer Scientist, understanding the intricate details of HOW
        the "sausage" is made is less important than proving it CAN be made.
        With a deep knowledge of how computers work, tools like Lambda Calculus
        or modeling languages such as Featherweight Java are more effective for
        expanding the capabilities and theoretical knowledge of programming. At
        this level, code is theoretical or language-agnostic.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Practical - Software Engineers:</b>
      <p>
        Software Engineers primarily focus on building practical implementations
        - often from theoretical foundations. This qualia uses intimate
        understanding of the underlying systems to engineer effective solutions.
        For Software Engineers, abstractions can be counterproductive; they need
        to grasp the detailed workings of the system to understand what they're
        implementing. Their expertise lies in bridging the gap between theory
        and practice, making them naturally adept with low-level concepts
        (pointers, memory allocation, etc).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Abstract - Software Developers:</b>
      <p>
        Software Developers excel in creating modern software solutions by
        integrating a wide array of topics. The vast breadth of knowledge
        required means they are adept at working with abstractions; Stitching
        together libraries, frameworks, pipelines, and infrastructure to develop
        programs that expand beyond the concepts of computer hardware. Their
        focus is on the end result rather than the underlying mechanics of how a
        computer performs tasks, making Developers incredibly capable of picking
        up new languages and building across computing domains.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Continuum</h3>
  <p>
    At this point, it's probably important to reiterate that the markers above
    indicate transitions along a continuum, and are not boxes each programmer
    must fit into. As an example, programmers with qualia between Computer
    Scientist and Software Engineer may find themselves naturally gifted with
    pure functional programming languages; and those who identify as "Back-End
    Engineers" are probably somewhere between "Software Engineer" and "Software
    Developer". Does this mean a "Back-End Engineer" can't write some
    <code>Haskell</code>? OF COURSE NOT! However, they may find the paradigms
    working against their "gut instinct."

    Qualia is also a mutable quality, though I speculate it requires youth or
    trauma (possibly the same thing in this context) to change significantly.
    Thus, having a particular qualia today doesn't mean you'll

    Thriving in environments where I have intimate knowledge of the core
    concepts behind each and every abstraction. I couldn't explain why this
    enables me to perform better, anymore than you could explain how life is
    like with an inner monologue (I don't have one). Knowing this about myself,
    I'm very quickly able to identify tasks where I will and won't excel.
    However, if you tell me to "just do it like this", I almost certain will
    need to build my own understanding (<a
