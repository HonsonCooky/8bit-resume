# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website - a static site hosting a collection of web available content about me; A space for
sharing and elaborating about who I am.

Go to `https://about.honsoncooky.dev` to see the output of this project.

For fellow developers looking into how I've developed my solution, I've opted for a [`Vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/)
build, utilizing [`Vuetify`](https://vuetifyjs.com/) as a base.

If you're a bit of a history diver, you'll notice that this repo has gone through many changes. I've played around with
different approaches to static sites - with opinions on each. This is not the 'best' one, but rather, the most recent
interest I've had in this area. When I want to play around with new UI frameworks, I'll use this space to play around.
