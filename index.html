                    Hailing from what my friends affectionately call a 'singing cult,' my formative years were steeped
                    in music and the performing arts. As I entered my late teens, curiosity beckoned me toward the world
                    of digital technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Armed with a knack for calculus and a flair for photography and theatre, I discovered programming -
                    an art form that blends creativity with methodical precision; A canvas with rules, yet near infinite
                    possibilities. Now, I've traded sheet music for syntax; my compositions resonate through elegant
                    algorithms, harmonizing data structures and orchestrating efficient solutions. Whether it's a
                    symphony of assembly code or a concerto in network protocols, I thrive on transforming theoretical
                    concepts into practical applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With 3 years of industry experience as a Software Engineer, my technical specializations are
                    currently anchored in <code>TypeScript</code> and <code>C#</code>; complemented by a wide array of
                    integration technologies. I aspire to engineer highly specialized, robust, and efficient software
                    solutions - delving into the intricate concepts of hardware itself. I am particularly keen on
                    advancing my knowledge in building solutions that require intimate understanding of the hardware
                    being built upon.

                        Switching from Z Energy to Xero has been quite an adventure. At Z Energy, I was behind the
                        scenes, building and maintaining internal systems. Now at Xero, I'm on a specialized team,
                        crafting software that plays a crucial role in the business and has a direct impact on users.
                        This transition has provided me with an exciting perspective shift. I'm surrounded with amazing
                        team members who are helping me expand my knowledge around developing software in a fast-paced,
                        user-centric environment.

                        Fresh from the gates of University, I landed a Graduate Developer role at New Zealand's largest
                        fuel provider - Z Energy. Primarily developing full-stack microservice data-centric solutions, I
                        was quickly promoted to an Intermediate Developer.

                    <p>
                        In this development environment the repo always described the cloud infrastructure, where
                        deployments to production were heavily documented and monitored. I was responsible for building
                        new systems and maintaining older systems. Additionally, I aided in analysing issues, enhancing
                        my understanding of system transparency and efficiency.

                        In the midst of my studies, I interned at Raygun during a summer break. Joining the small
                        business producing crash reporting and monitoring software, this marked my first role as a
                        developer in the industry. Working alongside another intern, we produced the React Native NPM
                        library for easy integration with Raygun's suite of software products. My experience at Raygun
                        allowed me to understand the production and distribution of libraries, which I've since used to
                        build internal libraries and frameworks.

                        It is said that teaching is the best way to learn. During my studies at Victoria University I
                        put this theory into practice and became a tutor; Providing support to students in Software
                        Engineering, Networking Engineering, and Computer Science disciplines. Tutoring for classes I've
                        taken previously, my responsibilities included running workshops and tutorials, also marking
                        assignments. This role afforded me the opportunity to master the art of conveying complex
                        technical subjects (such as C pointers and CPU threads) to a diverse student body with varying
                        degrees of technical proficiency. The ability to simplify and communicate intricate concepts
                        effectively has been invaluable in my current career, where I engage effectively with business
                        analysts, scrum masters, and product owners, facilitating clear and productive discussions.

                            Proper finger placement wasn't a skill I found necessary during my academic years. With time
                            to pause and think - improper placement rendered little impact to my physical health. Upon
                            entering the commercial domain, the addition of dedicated architects, hybrid working, and
                            the sheer verbosity of commercial <code>TypeScript</code> and <code>C#</code>, I saw a
                            significant increase in keystrokes per day; Highlighting the physical health concerns of my
                            existing typing style. After adopting proper finger placement and ergonomic keyboards, I
                            found the keyboard-mouse transition problematic and adopted a mouse-less setup with command
                            line interactions and keyboard shortcuts. Discovering Neovim for text-based needs, I started
                            with community configs and later built my own. Cross-platform, VSCode-like setups were slow,
                            so I trimmed my config to specific workloads. When attempting to learn unsupported
                            languages, I adopted an LSP-less setup (<a

                            requirement to understand everything that made a language viable - opting for simpler
                            languages like <code>Zig</code>. However, these setups were not viable for the commercial
                            environment I work in, and so I no longer use these tools. I spent 2 years exploring a pure
                            keyboard-centric programming style and may return to it in the future if I find myself in an
                            environment where deep knowledge and understanding of code are required. For now, I still
                            practice proper finger placement, albeit, with a slower approach to allow for mouse
                            utilization.

                            discovering the Advent of Code challenges has been a game-changer for me. When I find free
                            time during December nights, I dive into these puzzles with the same excitement I had as a
                            kid awaiting the holidays. They're a fantastic way for me to learn new programming languages
                            and explore innovative ideas, which might not fit into my usual routine. These experiences
                            have not only kept my technical skills sharp but have also rekindled a sense of wonder and
                            anticipation that makes December truly special.

                            Occasionally, I use my free time to explore new ideas and concepts from work (to prove
                            viability in an alternative approach). This repository represents one such instance where I
                            was attempting to figure out how to build a "Modular Monolith" using "Clean Architecture"
                            with the "MediatR" library. After some discussions about implementation ideas, I opted to
                            build and demonstrate my understanding - ultimately aiding in my own ideas and gut instincts
                            around the approach.

                <p>
                    Throughout my life, I've actively engaged in various groups and teams; Participating in sports,
                    bands, university projects, and diverse work environments. Whether leading or following, I've honed
                    my ability to adapt swiftly to different team dynamics.
                </p>

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Drawing from my thespian background and 3 years of tutoring, I have developed robust verbal
                    communication skills. Whether interacting with clients or colleagues, I excel in conveying ideas
                    effectively and fostering meaningful connections.
                </p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    My colleagues, mentors, and supervisors have praised my organizational skills, enthusiasm, and
                    reliability. I thrive in collaborative environments that value teamwork. I'm passionate about
                    creating and nurturing a workspace that inspires daily motivation and enthusiasm, making it worth
                    the early morning rise.

                <h3>Detail-Orientated</h3>
                <p>
                    With an education in Software Engineering, I'm wired to build most of my understandings from the
                    ground up; Engineering solutions with a comprehensive understanding. Whilst this can be a hindrance
                    during the initial build of a system, I've found this trait of mine to be critical for quick and
                    effective maintenance and debugging of production code.
