                        Hailing from what my friends affectionately call a 'singing cult,' my formative years were
                        steeped in music and the performing arts. As I entered my late teens, curiosity beckoned me
                        toward the world of digital technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Armed with a knack for calculus and a flair for photography, I discovered programming - an art
                        form that blends creativity with methodical precision. It's a canvas with rules, yet near
                        infinite possibilities. Now, I've traded sheet music for syntax; my compositions resonate
                        through elegant algorithms, harmonizing data structures and orchestrating efficient solutions.
                        Whether it's a symphony of assembly code or a concerto in network protocols, I thrive on
                        transforming theoretical concepts into practical applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With 3 years of industry experience as a Software Engineer, my technical specializations are
                        currently anchored in <code>TypeScript</code> and <code>C#</code>; complemented by a wide array
                        of integration technologies. I aspire to engineer highly specialized, robust, and efficient
                        software solutions - delving into the intricate concepts of hardware itself. My passion lies in
                        exploring and implementing theoretical concepts to make them practically viable. I am
                        particularly keen on advancing my knowledge in network technologies and low-level protocol
                        development.

                    <p>
                        I'm prepared to bring my distinctive mix of creativity and expertise to exciting projects. Are

                            Switching from Z Energy to Xero has been quite an adventure. At Z Energy, I was behind the
                            scenes, building and maintaining internal systems. Now at Xero, I'm on a specialized team,
                            crafting software that forms the backbone of the business and has a direct impact on users.
                            This transition has provided me with an exciting perspective shift. I'm surrounded with
                            amazing team members who are helping me expand my knowledge around developing software in a
                            fast paced, user centric environment.

                            Fresh from the gates of University, I landed a Graduate Developer role at New Zealand's
                            largest fuel provider - Z Energy. Luckily for me, the role came with a nurturing and
                            supportive environment. Primarily developing full-stack micro-service solutions, I was
                            quickly promoted to Intermediate Developer.

                            Adopting a GitHub-based development approach, the development style at Z Energy meant the
                            repo always described the cloud infrastructure and enabled seamless cloud deployments. I was
                            responsible for building new systems and maintaining older systems. Additionally, I aided in
                            analysing issues, enhancing my understanding of system transparency and efficiency.

                            In the midst of my studies, I interned at Raygun. Joining the small business producing crash
                            reporting and monitoring software, this marked my first role as a developer in the industry.
                            Working alongside another intern, we produced the React Native NPM library for easy
                            integration with Raygun's suite of software products. My experience at Raygun allowed me to
                            understand the production and distribution of libraries, which I've since used to build
                            internal libraries and frameworks.

                            It is said that teaching is the best way to learn. During my studies at Victoria University
                            I put this theory into practice and became a tutor; Providing support to students in
                            Software Engineering, Networking Engineering, and Computer Science disciplines. My
                            responsibilities included running workshops and tutorials, also marking assignments, for
                            classes I took a year before. This role afforded me the opportunity to master the art of
                            conveying complex technical subjects (such as C pointers and CPU threads) to a diverse
                            student body with varying degrees of technical proficiency. The ability to simplify and
                            communicate intricate concepts effectively has been invaluable in my current career, where I
                            engage effectively with business analysts, scrum masters, and product owners, facilitating
                            clear and productive discussions.

                                    Shortly after entering the industry, I switched to Neovim. During my time at
                                    university, proper finger placement wasn't a priority due to the sheer volume of
                                    learning materials. Upon entering the workforce, the high cadence of typing revealed
                                    the potential harm of improper finger placement. Learning proper finger placement
                                    then highlighted issues with staggered keyboard layouts. To solve this, I adopted a
                                    40% ortholinear keyboard, which minimized wrist movement. However, this led to
                                    another problem: frequent hand movements to the mouse. I addressed this by
                                    integrating Vim motions in VSCode, which eventually led me to Neovim. I utilized
                                    Neovim as my only editor for a year before switching to Vim.

                                        After spending a year with Neovim, I found myself wanting to explore some more
                                        uncommon programming languages and frameworks - Blazor and F#. Neovim tooling
                                        around these technologies was lack-luster at the time, which meant I needed to:
                                        A) Adopt another IDE, B) Avoid learning the language/framework, or C) Build the
                                        tooling myself. Broadening my horizons, I questioned whether my reliance on
                                        language servers and syntax highlighting was truly the path I wanted to follow (

                                        >). After exploring the capabilities of pure, language-agnostic Neovim, I
                                        discovered that I actually only needed the based Vim functionality to explore
                                        this world. Whilst I haven't adopted this at work yet, I am using this LSP-less
                                        Vim configuration as my personal IDE setup at the moment.

                                        Occasionally, I use my free time to explore new ideas and concepts. This

                                        to build a "Modular Monolith" using "Clean Architecture" with the "MediatR"
                                        library. After some dicussions around implementation ideas, I opted to build and
                                        demonstrate my understanding - ultimately aiding in my own ideas and gut
                                        instincts around the approach.

                        With an education in Software Engineering, I'm wired to build most of my understandings from the
                        ground up; Engineering solutions with a comprehensive understanding. Whilst this can be a
                        hindrance during the initial build of a system, I've found this trait of mine to be critical for
                        quick and effective maintenance and debugging of production code.
